SAMPLE 1:

-- Create a view with the top artists in 2017
CREATE VIEW top_artists_2017 AS
-- with only one column holding the artist field
SELECT artist_title.artist FROM artist_title
INNER JOIN top_15_2017
ON artist_title.reviewid = top_15_2017.reviewid;

-- Output the new view
SELECT * FROM top_artists_2017;



-----------------------

SAMPLE 2:
-- Redefine the artist_title view to have a label column
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW artist_title AS
SELECT reviews.reviewid, reviews.title, artists.artist, labels.label
FROM reviews
INNER JOIN artists
ON artists.reviewid = reviews.reviewid
INNER JOIN labels
ON labels.reviewid = reviews.reviewid;

SELECT * FROM artist_title;
